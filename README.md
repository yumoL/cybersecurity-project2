# Project 2 of Cybersecurity Course

### Introduction
Target machine: Metasploitable 3 running in VirtualBox (IP address: 172.28.128.3)

Attacker: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (physical machine) (IP address 172.28.128.1 and 192.168.1.166)

Before conducting attacks, run `sudo nmap -sS -sV -v -n -p- 172.28.128.3` to scan ports of target mahcine. `-sS` sends TCP SYN; `-sV` probes open ports to determine service/version info, `-v` represents verbose, showing the scan process, `-n` ignores DNS resolution as the target machine and the attacker are in the same internal network, and `-p-` scans all 65535 ports.

Result:

The following attacks were conducted based on [known exploits](https://stuffwithaurum.com/2020/04/17/metasploitable-3-linux-an-exploitation-guide/)
### Identified Attack 1: ProFTPD
The ProFTPD service is running on port 21.

### Identified Attack 3: Unreal IRCd
The Unreal IRCd application is running on port 6697.

Snort logs:

```
### Unidentified Attack 1: Docker Daemon Local Privilege Escalation
As shown in the [known exploits](https://stuffwithaurum.com/2020/04/17/metasploitable-3-linux-an-exploitation-guide/), the docker daemon running on the target mahcine exposes an unprotected TCP socket. We can use the session obtained from the attack on Unreal IRCd as this session is running by a user who is in docker group. First we keep the obtained session running on background:

Then we can conduct the attack:

Snort logs nothing about this exploit.

### Unidentified Attack 2: Brute-forcing SSH
In the previous attack it is possible to get a set of usernames.
![](https://github.com/yumoL/cybersecurity-project2/blob/main/images/usernames.png)
We save these usernames to [usernames.txt](https://github.com/yumoL/cybersecurity-project2/blob/main/usernames.txt). In the brute-forcing ssh, we test if there is such a credential where username and password are the same. Since we already know that the password of username "vagrant" is also "vagrant", we move "vagrant" to the second line of username list and run brute-forcing ssh:
![](https://github.com/yumoL/cybersecurity-project2/blob/main/images/ssh-exploit.png)
Snort does not raise any alert.
It is worth noting that if we move "vagrant" to the end of the usernames file and make the ssh attempt fail for several times, snort does raise alerts
```

```
The reason is that Snort raises such alerts only if the number of login failures/login attempt time is over a specific threshold.
